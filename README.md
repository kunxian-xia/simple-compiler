## Development Plan

- intermediate rep: three address code and SSA

- type definition and variable declaration
  basic type: int8, uint8, int16, uint16, int32, uint32, int64, uint64,
    float, double, char
  more complicate type: struct, class, array.

  storage allocation for a new instance of an struct 

- more expressions and type checking

- flow control: for-loop, while-loop

- runtime storage management
    - heap 

    - stack: temporaries, function calls

    - GC
